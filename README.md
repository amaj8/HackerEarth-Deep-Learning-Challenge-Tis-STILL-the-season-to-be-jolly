# Problem statement

An e-commerce platform is getting all geared up for a season clearance sale and plans to leverage social media as the primary channel to reach their audiences. The campaignâ€™s target group are individuals/families that have recently posted a picture of their indoor Christmas decor or are traveling during the holidays. 

You work at a leading social media platform and your team has been tasked to build a product recommendation engine for consumers. As part of the development team, your role is to use Deep Learning to develop a model that classifies images based on elements within the picture. These elements should be related to decor or holiday season vacations, such as a snowman, a Christmas tree, flights, and the like. 

# Dataset

The dataset consists of over 6000 training images and over 3000 test images. 

# My attempt

* Made an ensemble of VGG16 and ResNet50 
* Achieved a score of 88.10 on the leaderboard
